## Development Workflow

The Neural project follows a modular development approach, with each component having a specific responsibility. The main workflow is:

1. **Parsing**: The Neural DSL parser converts the DSL code into a model representation
2. **Shape Propagation**: The shape propagator infers and validates tensor shapes
3. **Code Generation**: The code generator converts the model representation into code for the target backend
4. **Execution**: The generated code is executed using the target backend
5. **Debugging**: NeuralDbg provides tools for debugging and visualizing the model

## Performance Optimization

The Neural CLI has been optimized for performance, particularly focusing on startup time. The main optimizations include:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Heavy dependencies are loaded only when needed
2. **Attribute Caching**: Frequently accessed attributes are cached
3. **Warning Suppression**: Debug messages and warnings are suppressed

These optimizations have significantly improved the startup time of the Neural CLI, especially for simple commands like `version` and `help` that don't require heavy ML frameworks.
