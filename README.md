# Code Complexity Analysis

Below is the complexity analysis for all Python files in this repository, generated using `radon`. Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through the code (lower is simpler).

| File | Avg. Cyclomatic Complexity | Lines of Code (LOC) | Comment Lines |
|------|----------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
